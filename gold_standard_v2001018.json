    "The Guardians Mikki Kendall wrote, \"In 'Flawless' (a track that leaked as 'Bow Down' over the summer), Beyonce quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TedX talk 'We should all be feminists', adroitly addressing the idea that she is somehow anti-feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her. It's clear that like a lot of black American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of her as much as anything else in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun."

    "Simon Colling from The West Australian described the performance as \"powerhouse\" and added, \"Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R&B) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott... [and] Mariah Carey\". Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times noted that despite the inclusion of almost 10 different musical styles in the show's set list, the singer's \"own [musical] signature\" and focus were lacking. Nevertheless, Horowitz praised the singer's performing skills and summarized the concert as \"a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring\". The Observers Barbara Ellen wrote, \"she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years\". However, she noted that Knowles is \"so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical.\" Noting influences by Tina Turner and Barbra Streisand during the tour, Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times writes: \"And she danced like only Beyonce can dance, with a combination of power, grace and smarts that fully unites Broadway choreography with urban street innovations ... Indeed, her production can be seen as a retelling of pop's history from a feminine viewpoint -- and as an argument for Beyonce as the ultimate realization of the female pop dream."

Pareles further noted that The wardrobe entices men, but it's also a means of self-assertion. J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the costumes during the show as spangly. Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the costumes saying that every one [is] fabulously glamorous, most of them tailored to highlight the singer's ample cleavage and a pair of legs to rival Tina Turner's. At one point, when the legs were concealed by a long scarlet gown, wind blew from underneath to expose them. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised the floor-length gown but disliked the tinfoil mini worn by Knowles. Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised Knowles' look, saying that she was like a glittering goddess in a revealing outfit. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also echoed her statements, to say that Beyonce looks terrific is probably redundant. Her fashion parade of form-fitting, eye-catching costumes – most notably a belly dancer's get-up in which she demonstrated some hip-shaking moves that indicated Shakira better watch her back – provided ample opportunities for shameless leering. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that the camouflage outfits her male dancers sometimes wore... felt right for a show that sometimes seemed like a military operation, expertly executed. Irish Independents Eamon Sweeney noted that Knowles looked absolutely stunning and added, I have to confess that the sight of Beyoncé ripping off a short cocktail dress to reveal a barely there bodysuit will linger in my memory for years to come. A writer of The StarPhoenix wrote that Knowles looked like a silver-clad siren rose further saying that it was almost surreal to see the woman who frequents the covers of fashion magazines in the same room. Tonya Turner from The Courier-Mail praised Knowles for looking every bit the dream girl in a sparkling silver floor-length gown."

      "Most historical writings about West Hollywood begin in the late-18th century with European colonization when the Portuguese explorer João Rodrigues Cabrilho traveled to and eventually laid claim on the region for Spain. Around 5,000 of the indigenous inhabitants from the Tongva Indian tribe canoed out to greet the ship. The Tongva tribe was a nation of hunter-gatherers known for their reverence for dance and courage. By 1771, these native people had been severely ravaged by the diseases brought in by the Europeans from across wide oceans. The Spanish mission system changed the name of the Tongva tribe to Gabrielinos, in reference to the Mission de San Gabriel. Early in 1770 Gaspar de Portola's Mexican expeditionary force stopped just south of the Santa Monica Mountains near what would become West Hollywood. Here they collected pitch (brea in Spanish) from tar pits which they used to waterproof their belongings and to say Mass. The Gabrielinos are believed to have burned the pitch for fuel."
